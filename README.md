# Dice game CDIO1 PROJECT DTU
This project focused on developing a two-player dice game in Java using object-oriented principles. The system consists of modular components, including classes for players, dice rolls, and game management. Key features include random dice generation, score management, and win conditions. Thorough testing ensured the system met performance and functional requirements. The result is a fully functional and efficient game that can be further enhanced with additional features in future iterations.
